## Structural Design Patterns
> Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping its structures flexible and efficient.

- ### Adapter
> Provides a unified interface that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- ### Bridge
> Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies - abstraction and implementation - which can be developed independently of each other.
- ### Composite
> Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
- ### Decorator
> Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- ### Facade
> Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
